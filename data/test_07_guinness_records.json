  "passage": "Who doesn't want to be the best in the world?\n\nWhy are we so fascinated by breaking records? For most people, the determination that you can do something better than anyone else in the world is a goal of strong ambition which People like setting goals, looking forward instantly. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> Taking like these, are easy to attempt but difficult to beat, such as eating three cheese biscuits in the fastest time (34.78 seconds). It's easier to beat an existing record than set a new one because 'firsts' have to be approved as suitable records to attempt.\n\n<span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> The general notes spell out the importance of evidence – photographic, video, independent witnesses – as much as you can get. For mass-participation records, you must prove that you've counted properly.\n\nGWR gives some general advice to newcomers: analyse the specific rules for your chosen record to spot and exploit any loopholes in them. For example, one German smashed the world record for eating an orange for a mile with his nose when he discovered that the rules didn't stipulate colour – he chose an unripe green orange that was hard, round and fast. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> But it's enough just to be able to do something unusual such as lick your elbow. You need to have the ability to go to the show as many times as possible in one hour – something that can then be attempted and broken by someone else.\n\nRecords will be dismissed if they are considered stupid, dangerous or illegal, or if there isn't enough evidence an organisation's judging marathon will take place because it was only attempted by two parents. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> Finally, don't cheat. One man, who broke the record for balancing the most drinking glasses on his chin, had his world record taken when he admitted to breaking the rules by using plastic cups.",
