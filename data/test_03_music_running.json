  "passage": "Runner Adharanand Finn took part in an unusual race in order to test the theory that music can make you run faster.\n\nAn expert on the effects of music on exercise, Dr Costas Karageorghis, claims that listening to music while running can boost performance by up to 15%. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> With the right beats, you find yourself running to the beat, which helps. It also brings out people to cheer you on. Rosie Bradford was also a convert: 'As we ran past one band and they started playing Those Boots Rise Music for Digging, everybody suddenly went faster.'\n\nThe only person I found who was less than happy with the music was Luis Lloyd. 'If there wasn't enough of it, and I found it wasn't loud enough to film with an MP3 player,' she said. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> Karageorghis is not surprised when I tell him. There are many advantages to listening to your own playlist, he says. In everything you can put during the running on the course, you can't by comparison with the playlist to your taste.\n\nAs I hung on to start my running, 4,000 other runners were preparing to test this theory. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> As I was starting I sang in my head with the beat, making it easy to keep in rhythm. According to the research, in benchmarks, the more extreme distance activities with the level of intensity of the running.\n\nUsually when they are preparing, and be focus on exactly when they are running and prepare where is possible to be distracted from what is going on around them. Making the pain of the running lightly obvious for me this time. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> Apart from the song at the start, which I barely remember, I mostly remembered The Best Just As Good music during the course: but it was so loud it was embarrassing.\n\nLater I was told me there was a direct correlation between the quality of the music on the course and how fast I ran. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> That quality, of course, is subjective. I remember the best-planned section as I ran past one band playing King of Leon's Your Hands. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span>\n\nOf course, the music wasn't the only thing there to help. It was also to help the beat tempo, but to provide a sense of occasion, drive out the pace and present it as a certain atmosphere. <span class='gap' data-gap='7'>[7]</span> The thing were beginning to wake after the end; fortunately at we often to see to help head it was a lifting way to finish the day.",
