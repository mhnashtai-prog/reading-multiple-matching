  "passage": "I was 22 and on a family holiday in the Caribbean Turks and Caicos Islands when it first happened. As we strolled along the beach, I knew a glint of blue among the seaweed. I realised it was a large bottle – and that there was something inside. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span>\n\nI'd always dreamed of finding a message bottle and yet once it was there in my hands were shaking as I unopened it. Inside the bottle, there was a letter on board a cruise ship: The Princess, from England back in 1987. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> It was a cruise ship letterhead, her name and address in Dover, and I tried tracing her for four years before I managed to get contact.\n\nI emailed the senders as soon as I got back to the island. They were happy to send me on a journey all the way across from Alicante and I'd found it!\n\nI remain the senders as soon as I got back to the island. Their letter was to say happy birthday, but perhaps disappointed he had it back because it was supposed to have arrived earlier. However, it was still an amazing experience. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> My family would get together and on cards and letters and we still receive them. We've been brought together entirely by chance and there are no guarantees we'll have another contact, but we know there's someone else who send these out. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> People who do the same get rather adventurous types and are often as excited to meet up as I am.\n\nA lot of people forget they've sent these messages and when you present them with items pieces of their personal history. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> When I called Ute, we another slips to Baltimore, I say on finding the phone I couldn't speak. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span> I'd had a lady woman. She told me her parents had sent that bottle while on a boat trip with her brother in the 1960s. It's discoveries like these that keep me interested in hunting for bottles.",
