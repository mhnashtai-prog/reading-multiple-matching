  "passage": "I'm a great believer in success, in achieving whatever goal you set on a particular day, so whether I was practising on the track or swimming in the pool, I've always put my heart and soul into it.\n\nWhen I was learning my trade, racing go-karts as a teenager, I went after my helmet and race number like a maniac, and soon discovered everything had to be perfect. It was all about preparation. At 16 I graduated to Formula Ford, and I'd even get the car up in the garage and polish the underside until it was gleaming. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> I made that point, jokingly, that if I ever rolled over in a race, I so wanted the world's cleanest underside in history.\n\nIt may be that my quiet achievement of Formula One fuelled this obsession with neatness and cleanliness. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> Racing is all about getting the extra tenth of a second. If you walk around a team factory it looks like a science laboratory. A Formula One factory couldn't be further from that. It's like something from another planet.\n\nEverything to aircraft standard and quality. And so it should be. If some single-out potential or some racks doesn't do people slouching around, that doesn't make a great impression. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> It took you walk in and everyone's working hard and there's not a speck of dust anywhere, that's another matter.\n\nPolishing my helmet was a specific ritual I had. The race helmet is an important and prized possession. When you're starting out, you only have one helmet for several years and it can be a pricey piece of kit. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> Once you're getting through probably a dozen or more expensive helmets each year. Normally I'd never have dreamed of wearing someone else's, but I still race 300 at the Monaco Grand Prix that year. I couldn't see properly. In the end I used one belonging to Nelson Piquet.\n\nIt may help that he'd second in the Brazilian Grand Prix with that same helmet and finished second in a different race. Two drivers wearing the same helmet and finishing second in different races. Four years later, Nelson said he wanted to swap another helmet with me. This was before he'd announced he was retiring, so my immediate thought was: what's with the helmet collection thing? <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> There must be something in it. So I gave him a helmet and he gave me a signed one.\n\nHelmets are treasured and it's quite rare for me to give race ones to anyone. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span> I only do it if I liked someone recently, although we've known each other for many years. The helmet I signed for him went for a collection there and I believe it sent the driver who bought it should be the other way round.",
