  "passage": "Paul Hardy reports on a blind runner called Simon Wheatcroft who enjoys taking part in marathon and ultra-marathon races, running distances between 42 km and 160 km.\n\nRunning marathons, a race of 42 km, has become increasingly popular. This distance poses extreme physical and mental challenges for anyone, but for those who have been blind since birth or have lost their sight later in life, the challenges are even greater. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span>\n\nFor the blind runner Simon, now 29, he has been overcoming this disability to compete in marathons, ultra-marathons and other races with runners who are not as his guides, and also, rather uniquely, by teaching himself to run solo, one on the streets. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> 'I'll have right-angled cornering obstacles,' he thought. 'If I have significant running obstacles,' he explains. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> Then he got bored again and wanted to try running solo again.\n\nWeeks of gradual exploration followed, walking a route over and over again. 'I break down sections into manageable parts with a heavy main road. He would measure the distance to the next obstacle, identify where each turn was located, stop off the area using a smartphone app. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> This information could then be transferred to a smartphone, enabling his phone to call out directions into his earphones.\n\nNow Simon knows precisely when all steps on the roads. Simon has been able gradually to increase the pace and can now run from six to thirty miles. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> When I first started, I had to run very cautiously at an achievable level to prevent the fall, and some other things were failing. Now it has evolved quietly and steadily. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span>\n\nBut for Simon the real thrill and motivation for training come from simply being able to compete successfully in races. 'I don't think this but I'm blind,' he says. 'But at the same time I would rather not have people really disappointed and not belong into a special group. Being visually impaired doesn't mean you can't run.'",
