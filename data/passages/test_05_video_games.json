  "title": "Game Changer: Why Video Games Deserve Respect",
  "passage": "Why do serious media commentators largely ignore the biggest entertainment medium in the world? Author Naomi Alderman investigates.\n\nWhy do video games receive so little coverage in the mainstream media? It's a question that's troubled me for years â€“ I even made a programme about it for the radio. Games are the biggest entertainment medium in the world, yet newspaper culture pages tend not to cover them. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> At least, that is the impression I get. They make it amazingly hard to get hold of new games, even for someone who writes about them.\n\nI write about novels as well as games and barely a day passes when a publisher isn't posting me a copy of a new book in the hope I'll review it or mention it somewhere. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> If the games industry wanted to be treated like other cultural media, it could start by making its work accessible to mainstream journalists.\n\nThere's a timing issue too. In the past, I've tried to persuade review programmes to cover games more frequently. But I always seem to come up against the same old problem. Film companies organise pre-release screenings, TV companies send out early versions of their shows, book publishers send copies of new books, theatres do preview shows. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> Games companies seem to release advance versions of games. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span>\n\nFurthermore, the games industry itself does not seem too bothered about being covered in broadsheet culture sections, because it doesn't think this would sell more games. It is already the biggest selling entertainment industry in the world in any case. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> It's a fair point. But I wish the industry would cooperate anyway because I feel the importance and interest to be regarded as such in the mainstream media.\n\n<span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span> The situation is very different with books, films, and television programmes, where creators actively seek critical attention and cultural recognition alongside commercial success.",
