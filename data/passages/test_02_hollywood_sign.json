  "passage": "I am responsible for maintaining and protecting the sign. <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> When I first arrived in 1996, security was pretty low-tech – we put up a fence around the sign to stop trespassers messing with it. But people just jumped over the fence. The back of the sign was black with graffiti – there was barbed wire across it, but they still got through. So I decided to improve the effectiveness of the security.\n\nNow we have motion-detectors and cameras. Everything goes via the internet to a dedicated surveillance team watching various structures around the city. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> But you can get a closer look at one of my regular tours.\n\nIt's also important to protect the sign's image as it's used in loads of adverts and news pieces. There's a simple rule about how the sign can be used. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> However, it mostly comes down to the look. To take a different example, if you used 'Hollywood' in the name of your bakery, it would depend what the word looked like, whether it was just spelled out or whether the image of the sign itself was used.\n\nPeople call up with the most ridiculous ideas. They want to light the sign, paint it pink, or cover it in something to promote their product. You'll get a really enthusiastic marketing manager on the phone, terribly excited because they think they're the first person to think of this or that idea. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> That's because we don't like to change the image and we hope it will have the same significance for generations to come.\n\nIn the past, TV started to become popular and some Hollywood film studios closed, but then TV companies moved in and grew them over. At this point, the city of Los Angeles decided to renovate the sign. The letters spelling 'land' were removed and it was repaired. Modern Hollywood was born. The letters in the sign weren't straight and still aren't. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> They follow the shape of Mount Lee as part of their base.\n\nSome family came here to renew. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span> I can't say they stopped by to visit and ran round. But what did other visitors make of the actual?",
