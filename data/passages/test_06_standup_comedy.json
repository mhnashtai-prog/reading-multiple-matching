  "passage": "Monica Platter describes how her experiences on a stage performing stand-up comedy helped her to get better at giving presentations for work.\n\nI work in marketing, but I've always fancied trying stand-up comedy on the stage. Earlier this year, I finally plucked up courage and made a serious bid to understand on stage at a comedy club. The experience provided me with some useful lessons for the usual speaking I do in my normal job.\n\nTo start with, having been trying to be funny on stage is a long-time goal. Five minutes are normally fine, just as the start of a work presentation usually goes well. But then a rather awkward 25 minutes often follow. I tend to speak very quickly and run out of things to say far too early, leaving me with a few difficult experiences at the club I realised I needed to speak at half the pace, so that even if I immediately made too short, <span class='gap' data-gap='1'>[1]</span> I've subsequently tried to slow down for the presentations I give at work, and it's definitely helped.\n\nI also learned that you shouldn't judge your performance by the audience's reaction. If they aren't laughing, it doesn't necessarily mean they don't think that you're funny. <span class='gap' data-gap='2'>[2]</span> Similarly, in a presentation, if your audience doesn't readily excited, it might just be that they don't show much emotion. You might have heard good feedback up to that point. <span class='gap' data-gap='3'>[3]</span> Do feel and you'll end up feeling better.\n\nEvery comedian I met at the club said that knowing how to pause is crucial. <span class='gap' data-gap='4'>[4]</span> They get the joke and wait in suspense to find out what the setup for. I've realised that the same principle applies to other types of public speaking. It's something I've really improved on since those early days.\n\nI also learned that even comedians who seem very confident and polished, I would often stand at the same jokes as the others, deliver what I thought was calm and polished. <span class='gap' data-gap='5'>[5]</span> If you walk around a team factory, it could nevertheless to that same job, probably instead I'd be good confidence. Similarly, every comedian felt the same need.\n\nThe bottom line with stand-up comedians however, is that it's always been about performance and delivery. Everything I saw of the comedy club confirmed that. <span class='gap' data-gap='6'>[6]</span> I've been to great shows where 70% of the humour came from the comedian's facial expressions, and eyebrow movements seem particularly important. I've been focusing on improving my eyebrow life when I'm giving work presentations, I'm still not as good as I'd like, but I'm making progress, and much of this is down to what I've learned from stand-up.",
